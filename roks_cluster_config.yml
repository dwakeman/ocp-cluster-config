# The main playbook for running the cluster configuration
# It will include sub-playbooks through the roles that
# are listed. Each role must define a tasks/main.yml file
# that will be executed
- hosts: localhost
# Localhost is used as the host because Ansible
# will make the connection through the k8s module
# to the OpenShift API server rather than to a host
# itself through SSH

# Configuration tasks needed to finalize the cluster config after provisioning
#
# - Enable private endpoints or disable public one, or both
# - Enable Key Protect
# - Enable Logging to LogDNA
# - Enable Monitoring to SysDig
# - Patch the developer catalog to have the service tiles removed ******
# - HPA with custom metrics *****
# - Enable Kube API audit logging to LogDNA (if needed)
# - install and configure IBM Cloud Operator
#   - install the operator (assume manual update)
#   - create a new namespace called "ico-management" that will contain the secrets and configmaps for each team
#   - Update the operator when a new version is available
# - Install and configure Service Mesh
# - Enable Container Image Security Enforcement: 
#   - Whitelisted Registries: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=registry-security_enforce#cluster-wide


# Configuration tasks for onboarding a new application team
#
# These tasks are needed in IBM Cloud
# - Create a resource group for the team
# - Create an IAM Access Group for the team
# - Create access policies in the access group as appropriate:
#   - permission to provision the approved services in the resource group
#   - permission to the appropriate private catalog
#   - viewer platform role to the resource group for the cluster
#   - Viewer platform role for the cluster itself (to see the cluster in the IBM Cloud Console)
#   - Writer service role on the cluster, scoped to the team namespace
# - Create a Service ID and API Key for the IBM Cloud Operator to use
# - Add the Service ID to the team IAM Access Group
# - Create a new namespace for the team
# - Add resource quotas for the namespace, if needed
# - Configure the IBM Cloud Operator in the team namespace
#   - Create a configmap in the team namespace named <team-namespace>-ibm-cloud-operator
#     - data:    namespace: ico-management
#   - Create a secret in the ico-management namespace called <team-namespace>-secret-ibm-cloud-operator
#   - Create a configmap in the ico-management namespace called <team-namespace>-config-ibm-cloud-operator
# - Add project to Service Mesh member roll
# - Create any other Istio-related resources that Platform Admin wants to require.
# - Create routes for application?  Not sure if this happens right away or later as a separate playbook
# - Create Service Credentials for Event Streams Enterprise.  Scope it to wildcards for that team.
# - Create a secret in the team namespace that would be the equivalent to what the operator would do for a binding object
